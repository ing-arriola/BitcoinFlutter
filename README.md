# Bitcoin Ticker ðŸ¤‘

## My Goal

The objective on this project was learning about Cupertino (iOS) and Material Widgets (Android) in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.

## What I created?

I made a crypto currency price checking app. So if you check my app you'll be able to monitor your bitcoin investents on the move!

## What I learned

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets.
- How to check the platform my app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Render an array of widgets with data coming from an API
